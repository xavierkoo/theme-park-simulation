attractions-own [
  attraction-type ; "ride" or "activity". Determines the type of attraction, affecting how visitors interact with it.
  popularity ; A numeric value indicating its popularity. Higher values may influence visitor preferences or queue lengths.
  ride-length ; How long a ride takes
  waiting-count ; Number of visitors currently waiting in the queue for this attraction.
  queue ; List of visitors waiting for this attraction. Used to manage the order and number of visitors.
  attraction-name ; The name of the attraction. Used for identification and possibly displayed in the simulation interface.
  attraction-popularity ; A boolean indicating if the attraction is considered popular (true) or not (false). May affect visitor choice.
  visited ; A flag (usually true/false) indicating whether an attraction has been visited by a visitor. Useful for tracking visitor movement.
  predecessor ; Refers to the previous attraction visited by a visitor. Can be used to track visitor paths or for analysis purposes.
  ride-capacity ; A list of visitors currently on the ride or participating in the activity. Indicates how many visitors are being served.
  ride-time ; The remaining time for the current ride or activity session to complete. A countdown to when the next group can be served.
  capacity ; The maximum number of visitors that can be accommodated by the attraction at one time. Influences how many visitors can be moved from the queue to the ride-capacity list.
